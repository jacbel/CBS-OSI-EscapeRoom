_One of the superstars fighting against the monopoly of the large publishers, and literally breaking down pay-walls is the developer of the website ***SciHub***._

_In order to unlock the door and "escape" the room, you need to collect three colors_

1.  _The flag of the country where the founder of SciHub originated from has the colors blue and â€¦_
1.  _What is the color of the key in the SciHub logo?_
1.  _What is the default color of the well-known Open Access logo?_

_When you're sure about your answers you can continue_

_The last step is to go to the source of this website on GitHub, where people commonly share scripts publicly_

_Here's the link: [github.com/jacbel/CBS-OSI-EscapeRoom](https://github.com/jacbel/CBS-OSI-EscapeRoom)_

_Somewhere in this repository is a file with the link to the exit._
_The name of this file contains the three colors you found above. Go find this file in the repository and follow the link!_
