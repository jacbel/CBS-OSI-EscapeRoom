_So you think you've collected all the letters, you should have 14 of them by now. These letters together form a word, or a name rather_

_The name refers to a Nature journal that recently increased its APC. The next clue is the new APC in 2021 in US dollars of this journal. You may use Google to find the APCs_

_Here's how you unlock the key:_
-   _Open a new tab in your browser_
-   _Write this text on a piece of paper: `jacbel.github.io/CBS-OSI-EscapeRoom/items/`_
-   _Append the four digits of the APC to this text (like `jacbel.github.io/CBS-OSI-EscapeRoom/items/####`)_
-   _Type this url in an empty tab in your browser, and go have a look what you find there!_
