<p>In our version we will not lock the room, but the game will finish when you complete the last task in the last item you unlock. The game will be linear, meaning once you&rsquo;ve completed one puzzle and unlocked an item you will get a clue to the next puzzle. However, you might happen to stumble upon some clues for later puzzles whilst looking around in the room. If you do, it is best if you make a note of what it was and where you found it and continue with the puzzle you were working on.</p>
<p>If you get stuck we can give you a hint in the chat. You have 50 minutes to complete all the tasks, but you might finish sooner! The game will start when you make the first choice. This might not make much sense now, but it will soonâ€¦  Is everything clear?</p>
<h3 id="images-buttons-and-links">Images, buttons, and links</h3>
<p>Buttons like the one below (with the work &ldquo;Go&rdquo; in the green box) will guide you through the story, make sure to follow them! Occasionally, images, emojis, and gifs are clickable too! So keep an eye out! ðŸ˜‰</p>

</p>
<p>The menu will always be visible below. Here you can go back to start, read the instructions, and go to a list of all the tasks if you&rsquo;re lost. In the &ldquo;about&rdquo; page, you can read information about the website and the concept. In the &ldquo;tasks&rdquo; menu, you can also jump ahead, but that would be cheating, and we hope we don&rsquo;t have any cheaters here?</p>
