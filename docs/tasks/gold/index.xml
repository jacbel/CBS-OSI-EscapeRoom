      <description>Making something Open Access via the Gold route means to publish in a way that allows immediate access to all readers free of charge. This is done by publishing in Open Access Journals, where authors often pay an APC (Article Processing Charge) to publish. The MONEY for the APC usually comes from the funder or institution (if the institution has an Open Access fund), so authors very rarely pay this charge out of their own pocket.</description>
