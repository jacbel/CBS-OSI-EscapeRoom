      <description>Making something Open Access (freely available with no costs for the reader or the author) via the Green route means to publish in a subscription journal, but making the AAM (Author Accepted Manuscript) available for free in an institutional or subject specific repository. This is called self-archiving. The AAM is the last version of the manuscript (after peer review) that has been accepted for publication, but has not had journal formatting.</description>
